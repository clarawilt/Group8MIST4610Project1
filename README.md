# Problem Description:
The client scenario we are modeling revolves around the operations of Elite Tennis Academy. The client’s primary goal is to optimize club operations as the Elite Tennis Academy offers a variety of tennis-related services and programs that cater to a diverse clientele. The services include coaching, membership options, court reservations, tournament hosting, and various club events. Clients can utilize the online booking system to streamline the services offered. The mission of Elite Tennis Academy is to utilize the model and database to create structured queries to provide insight into the Tennis Elite Academy and resources it has to offer.

1. Query 1 lists the coach name, years of experience, and salary ordered by descending years of experience.
<img width="626" alt="Screenshot 2023-11-03 at 10 19 42 AM" src="https://github.com/clarawilt/Group8MIST4610Project1/assets/131196224/0d7fd690-13e0-4814-926a-c76102215fb0">

Query 1 allows managers to get a good general overview of each coach. Coach salary and years of experience can be essential data points used for         contract negotiations and renewals. It can help both managers and coaches ensure that the terms of the contract are fair and competitive.

2. Query 2 lists the guest’s name who have attended more than 2 tournaments and how many they have attended.
<img width="618" alt="Screenshot 2023-11-03 at 10 22 53 AM" src="https://github.com/clarawilt/Group8MIST4610Project1/assets/131196224/9481033f-81fa-4972-ac8e-ec95e93533c1">

Query 2 allows managers of the tennis club to see what guests have attended more than half of the tournaments that are played at the club. Since these tournaments bring in revenue, management of the club could potentially offer discounts in the future for guests as a way to show appreciation and incentivize them even more to come back since they already frequently go to the tournaments. 

3. Query 3 lists the court number and its capacity if the capacity is greater than or equal to 200 and less than 400. 
<img width="620" alt="Screenshot 2023-11-03 at 10 44 49 AM" src="https://github.com/clarawilt/Group8MIST4610Project1/assets/131196224/abd359f4-8a4f-43cc-8136-3d8708457a55">

Query 3 is useful because the court capacities determine how many spectators can be accommodated in each stadium or court. This information is crucial for ticket sales and pricing, seating arrangements, and scheduling and match coordination when planning out matches with medium anticipated attendance. 

4. Query 4 shows the member type and the number of members in each type.\

Query 4 is useful because the management of the tennis club will need to keep a running tally of each type to maintain their ideal membership total.

5. Query 5 lists the average booking fee among all birthday themed events.
<img width="623" alt="Screenshot 2023-11-03 at 10 29 11 AM" src="https://github.com/clarawilt/Group8MIST4610Project1/assets/131196224/3be97486-001c-4617-b67c-d5111ec2ccc5">

Query 5 allows managers to create a baseline estimate for customers inquiring about hosting possible birthday events. This allows the process of booking a birthday even to be streamlined and more efficient for both parties.

6. Query 6 shows the percentage of adolescent guests that attended the tournaments throughout the calendar year.
<img width="621" alt="Screenshot 2023-11-03 at 10 30 19 AM" src="https://github.com/clarawilt/Group8MIST4610Project1/assets/131196224/789ac5c1-5002-4b34-a5a0-91f3aa5e60e4">

Query 6 is useful for managers because it shows the distribution of adolescents at the tournaments. With this figure managers can determine whether or not they want to attempt to maintain this number or market towards increasing it for the coming year.

7. Query 7 lists the name and salary of the highest paid coach
<img width="371" alt="Screenshot 2023-11-03 at 10 31 07 AM" src="https://github.com/clarawilt/Group8MIST4610Project1/assets/131196224/86777db5-8237-4fe5-8c22-d5ce419f61c9">

Query 7 is useful because the salry of the highest paid coach is crucial for making strategic decisions regarding the composition and structure of the coaching staff. It can influence decisions about promoting, hiring, or reassigning coaches to align with the organization's goals.

8. Query 8 lists the total booking fees for each court, and lists these in descending order.
<img width="621" alt="Screenshot 2023-11-03 at 10 32 13 AM" src="https://github.com/clarawilt/Group8MIST4610Project1/assets/131196224/fe527e04-ec27-4870-a0af-1b5482ab3f78">

Query 8 is useful because it analyzes which courts generate the most revenue and then managers can tailor marketing and promotion efforts to highlight those specific courts, attracting more customers and increasing overall bookings. Courts with the most revenue can be given peak time slots to maximize profits and engagement. 

9. Query 9 lists out the player’s information for those whose age is greater than the average age of all players. It is ordered from the oldest age to the youngest age.
<img width="613" alt="Screenshot 2023-11-03 at 10 39 06 AM" src="https://github.com/clarawilt/Group8MIST4610Project1/assets/131196224/eb9776e9-cbc6-49c0-8f7f-a3a8bbf74d41">

Query 9 can be useful for program development. Different age groups can influence the types of activities and programs these players may want to participate in. The tennis club can then tailor its advertising promotions to specific age groups. 

10. Query 10 shows the names of patrons who have not yet booked an event.
<img width="601" alt="Screenshot 2023-11-03 at 10 56 04 AM" src="https://github.com/clarawilt/Group8MIST4610Project1/assets/131196224/7840e495-2b66-4967-b7a1-0690fdead5e1">

Query 10 would be useful information for management because they can reach out to these patrons via email or phone. By reaching out to them, they can understand their reasons for not booking an event and address any concerns the patron may have.
